                Based on the didactics beside the artwork, the Suspended Healing Garden is created with Pantea Karimi's identity in mind. She recalls early childhood memories of trips with her grandmother to traditional Iranian drugstores, with those memories serving as inspiration for the garden and its foliage. The upside-down display of the artwork comes from the upheaval of immigration from Karimi’s experience of immigrating to the US.

                There are engravings from an ancient Iranian 12th-century medicinal manuscript on each cutout of herbs in the garden. Written by Abu Jafar al-Ghafiqi, the Kitab fi’l-adwiya al-mufrada, or Book of Simple Drugs, depicts written descriptions and over 400 hand-drawn illustrations of plants and animals and lays the foundation for Iranian medicine.
