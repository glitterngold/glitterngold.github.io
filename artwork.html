              The Suspended Healing Garden is an artwork located in the McMullan Art Museum. Created by Pantea Karimi, the artwork contains countless distinctive paper cutouts of plants, leaves, and herbs, all dangling from wooden rods supported by fishing lines. The black and white vegetation, inspired by traditional Iranian herbs and drugs, contain laser-engraved Arabic text from ancient Iranian medicinal manuscripts. The deliberate lighting of the room illuminates the piece, casting shadows on the blank wall behind it, making it seem as if one is in a lush, plentiful forest instead of a tidy, minimalistic museum.
